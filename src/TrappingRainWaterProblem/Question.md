### Trapping rain water problem overview
Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1. 
Compute how much water it can trap after raining!![](../../../../Pictures/Screenshots/Screenshot from 2022-09-17 18-06-30.png)
> Here the elevation map (the input for the algorithm) is [4,1,3,1,5] and the output is the total units of trapped rain water - which is 7.

Good luck!
