# Linked lists in Java !!!
### In the previous lectures we have discussed linked lists. In a singly linked list we store a reference to the first node (head node) exclusively. 
### Which means that if we want to insert items to the end of the linked list then we have to iterate through the list first - this is why it takes O(N) running time.

> BUT IN JAVA'S LINKED LIST, THERE IS A REFERENCE TO THE LAST NODE OF THE LINKED LIST AS WELL !!!

#### It means of course that inserting items (and removing items) to the end of the linked list takes O(1) constant running time complexity.
