# Reversing an array in-place overview
### The problem is that we want to reverse a T[] array in O(N) linear time complexity and we want the algorithm to be in-place as well - so the algorithm can not use additional memory!

> For example: input is [1,2,3,4,5] then the output is [5,4,3,2,1]

Good luck!
