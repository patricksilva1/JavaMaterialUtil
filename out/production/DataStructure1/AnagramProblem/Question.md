# Anagram problem overview
Your task is to construct an algorithm to check whether two words (or phrases) are anagrams or not!

#### '"An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once"

> For example: restful and fluster are anagrams.

Good luck!
